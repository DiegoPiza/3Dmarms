# Source code to ' Primacy of vision shapes behavioral strategies and neural substrates of spatial navigation in the hippocampus of the common marmoset'
This repository contains the source code to replicate the analyses that were done in this work (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.24.542209).
Sample data will accompany each script to run a demo.
Instructions and run time to run the analyses will be included as comments in the scripts.
The state of this repository is preliminary, we are still in the process of updating the scripts to improve readability and compatibility across platforms.
